Problem :
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

Solution:

Firstly, I created an array from 0 to 19 along with their length because we can see that they don't have common pattern between them. Then I created another array of 10th multiple starting from 20 to 90 as we can see common 10 common in them. 

Function named below100 is used to calculate our desired output for number between 0 and 99. There are two cases like n<20 then we have array defined else we can use both array and determine length for desired output

Function named number length is used to calculate the length of number between 100 and 1000. Some mathematical portion is done if there is number >= 100 
String "and" is added if there is number like for example 548 Five hundred and fourty-eight.

Finally, final_solution function provides us result by using for loop.
